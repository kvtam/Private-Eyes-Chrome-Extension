# Private-Eyes-Chrome-Extension
/////Author's Notes
A chrome extension I made to automate filling out the forms please edit it as you need and branch or update the repo.
However, please keep the vulpix as the icon, it's cute.

/////Instructions
  1. Download the repo as a zip file or use a bash terminal to clone the repo

  2.Go to your Extension settings in Chrome and set it to developer mode in the top right corner of the screen.
  
  3.In the top left corner select the leftmost button "Load Unpacked", select the Extension folder in Private-Eyes-Chrome_Extension/PE autofiller/ 
  
  4.Now when you are on the new site edit the name field to your judgement and hit the Vulpix icon to execute the script
    
    4a. As of ver 0.5 a prompt will appear asking about the BG color. You should use a single letter (W=White/B=Black) case insensitive.
  
  5.The title field to the EN_description field should be filled in. You may need to edit the fields to make sure they make sense so double check.

  	5a. As of version 0.2 edits the Case field but needs more input to work for more phrases.
  
  6.Does not edit any other fields at the moment but anticipate this for a future update.
  
 ////Version 0.5t update(You need an API key to use this version)
  -clicking on the vulpix now edits the fields and translates the first html textbox at the bottom. translated text comes as an alert you can copy/paste
  -(CTRL+Shift+4) translates the second txt box in the same manner
  
  
  
/////Future Ideas

  1. Get it to translate automatically using the DeepL API *DONE
  2. Learn how to implement this using Regex (Right now the code is a crime against humanity) *DONE
